# gist-lister 1.0
ReactJS, NodeJS and Express app that currently lists my gists and profile via the Github API.

## Installation
1. Git clone repository with `git clone https://github.com/angelavu/gist-lister.git` in the command line or download the ZIP of the latest release and unzip into a folder
2. In the command line, change directory to gist-lister: `cd gist-lister`
3. Run `npm start`. This will also run a prestart which will install all the necessary packages and automatically start the project at the end.
4. Yay! It should start automatically or view the project at [http://localhost:30025/](http://localhost:30025)

## Getting Started
1. To view the app, go to [http://localhost:30025/](http://localhost:30025)
2. Click the buttons to query my profile and gists! Hamburger menu on the left showcases the list of pages for this app.
3. To view the server, go to [http://localhost:30032/](http://localhost:30032).
4. To view the API call responses for querying a GitHub Profile, go to [http://localhost:30032/git-api/user](http://localhost:30032/git-api/user) or click the link on the server homepage.
5. To view the API call responses for querying gists, go to [http://localhost:30032/gists/get-basic-list](http://localhost:30032/gists/get-basic-list) or click the link on the server homepage.

## Future Fixes
* Allow for user input to showcase any GitHub user's public gists
* Use SASS SCSS
